:::caution
This section contains information about the old Java Spec API.
For new development, the Kotlin API is recommended (see the [Animating View Properties with Dynamic Props](animations/dynamic-props-bindto.mdx) page in the 'Animations' section).
:::

:::note
Dynamic props are properties that are applied directly to a `View` or `Drawable`. They are updated without computing a layout or remounting. This makes them efficient for use in animations or other dynamic UIs. Dynamic props are initialised and updated using [`DynamicValue`](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/DynamicValue.html).
:::

## `DynamicValue`

To control a dynamic prop, you should create a `DynamicValue` and assign it to that prop. You can then keep a reference to the `DynamicValue` and use it to directly set values (such as in a callback or an `Animator`). Use the `set()` function to set new values from the main thread.

:::caution
`DynamicValue`s should only be updated on the main thread.
:::

## Common Dynamic Props

The dynamic properties that are available for all `Component`s are:

* Alpha
* Scale X/Y
* Translation X/Y
* Background Color
* Foreground Color
* Rotation
* Elevation (from Lollipop and above)

To use these, create and pass a `DynamicValue<T>` object to the component.

For Spec components these props can be set in the builder:

```kotlin
MyComponent.create(c).alpha(dynamicAlpha).build()
```

The `DynamicValue` can be updated by calling its [`set()`](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/DynamicValue.html#set-T-) function.

The following code sample shows a `Component` that renders a square in the middle of the screen. The alpha and scale props have been set to the DynamicValue's, which are updated by two SeekBars.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/CommonDynamicPropsComponentSpec.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

The following short animation illustrates the component in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/common_dynamic_props.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

To see how other common dynamic props can be modified, see the [All Common Dynamic Props](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/AllCommonDynamicPropsKComponent.kt) example in the Sample app, which is illustrated in the following animation.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/all_dynamic_props.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

## Custom Dynamic Props for MountSpecs

`MountSpec`s can define custom dynamic props. Props annotated with `@Prop(dynamic = true)` can be set to a `DynamicValue`. Setting this value will trigger a custom `@OnBindDynamicValue` function in the component.

Consider a `MountSpec` that renders a clock face:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/ClockFaceSpec.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

Here, the `MountSpec` delegates the drawing of a clock face to `SimpleClockView`. Marking the `time` prop with `@Prop(dynamic = true)` will cause an additional method to be generated in the builder that accepts a `DynamicValue`. The method to set a static value will also remain available. When `set()` is called on the `DynamicValue`, the `@OnBindDynamicValue` function will be executed. In this example, the new time is passed to the `ClockView` to draw the updated clock face.

Next, consider a slider to set the time on the clock face.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/CustomDynamicPropsComponentSpec.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

This is illustrated in the following short animation.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/custom_prop_slider.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

## Animating Dynamic Props

Dynamic Props values can be used with Android Animators to create custom animations. The following example uses a [ValueAnimator](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ValueAnimator) to animate the dynamic value `time`, defined in the previous value.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/AnimateDynamicPropsComponentSpec.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

A `DynamicValue` is used to represent time.  This is passed to the `Component` as a prop and kept as a reference to it so it can be updated. In a click event, a ValueAnimator is set up that updates the time `DynamicValue` each frame (see the following animation). The [ValueAnimator](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ValueAnimator) is stored in a reference so that it can be cancelled if necessary.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/custom_prop_animation.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

For more examples of creating Animations using Common Dynamic Props, see the [Animations Cook Book](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/animationcookbook) in the Sample App.
