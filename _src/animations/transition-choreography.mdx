Litho provides several APIs to customise many aspects of transitions and animate different components together.

## Sequence, Stagger, and Parallel sets

Transitions can be composed using the following:

* `Sequence` - all transitions are run in order. Each transition must end before the following one starts.
* `Stagger` - all transitions are a run in order. There is a fixed delay between starting each transition, and they may overlap.
* `Parallel` - all transitions start at the same time but may end at different times.

The following code uses a `stagger` set to animate three different rectangles.

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/StaggerTransitionComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

The following animation shows this component in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/stagger.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

Transition sets can be nested within each other, for example, you could have a 'stagger' of 'parallel' animation sets.

Sequences and Staggers support interrupting behaviour, which ensure a component will never jump and will always end up in the correct end position.

The sets can also be used to animate different properties of the same component, as shown in the following example:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/StaggerTransitionSameComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

The following animation shows this component in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/stagger3.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

## Animators

Animators affect the rate in which new values are pushed to the animated components. An `Animator` can be added to any transition with the `.animator()` builder method.

Litho provides two Animators:

* **Spring-based** - see the [SpringTransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.SpringTransitionAnimator.html)
* **Timing-based** - see the [TimingTransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.TimingTransitionAnimator.html)

These Animators can be configured to cover most use cases.

It's possible to configure a custom transition by implementing [Transition.TransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.TransitionAnimator.html).

By default, all transitions in Litho run by the [SpringTransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.SpringTransitionAnimator.html), which is physics based and naturally interruptible. You can tune the parameters of this spring by creating another `Animator` using `Transition.springWith()` and pass custom tension and friction.

In addition, the [TimingTransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.TimingTransitionAnimator.html) enables you to set a total time and an `Interpolator`. To do this, use the builder `Transition.timing()` that receives the total time and an optional `Interpolator`.

:::info
The default interpolator for the [TimingTransitionAnimator](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.TimingTransitionAnimator.html) is an `AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator`.
:::

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/ParallelTransitionWithAnimatorsComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

The following animation shows this component in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/transitions/stagger4.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>


### TransitionEnd callback

A Listener can be added to receive a callback when an individual transition has ended. This is done through Litho event dispatcher methods (see [Events Overview](../codegen/events-for-specs.md)).

The `TransitionEndEvent` will be called with the transition key and the specific `AnimatedProperty` that has been animated for that key. If multiple instances of `AnimatedProperty` are added to the same transition, and all of them run at the same time, a callback will be executed for each. This callback may be useful to loop animations by updating the tree.

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/docs/SequenceTransitionLoopComponentSpec.java start=start end=end
```

:::note
Many examples can be found in the Litho Sample app: `API Demos`->`Animation Callbacks`.
:::

A `transitionEndHandler` can also be added to `Transition.allLayout()` where the same logic applies:

```java
@OnCreateTransition
static Transition onCreateTransition(ComponentContext c) {
    return Transition.allLayout().transitionEndHandler(MyComponentSpec.onTransitionEndEvent(c));
}
```
