## What is a component?

**Components** are the fundamental building blocks of UIs in Litho. They consist of a render function that can use the component's **props** and **state** to configure and return other components. The returned components are further resolved by recursively calling `render` on them until the process results in **primitives** like `Text` or `Image`, which can be positioned and materialized on the screen.

The following example shows a component that takes a name as a prop and renders a greeting with a `Text` component.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/HelloComponent.kt start=start_simple_example end=end_simple_example
```

**What's the relationship between a component and a view?**

In practice, a component is just a type and a bag of props and is cheap to instantiate. Instantiating a component does not instantiate a View. At **mount** time, only primitive components that mount Views or have View properties (such as `viewTag`) will materialize Views in the final layout.

## Declaring a Component

A component is declared as a simple sub-class of `KComponent`, overriding a single function: `render`. You can declare the **props** a component takes as standard `val` properties; as is normal in Kotlin, these may be declared as optional by providing a default value.

To instantiate an existing component, specify the props in the constructor of that component. By convention, named arguments are used for clarity, even if the prop is required:

```kotlin
Text(text = "Hello $name!")
```

Note that KComponents are only supported in Kotlin; if you need to declare a component from Java, look at the [legacy Spec API](/codegen/layout-specs.mdx).

### Rules for components

For correctness, Litho components must follow two functional-programming rules:

1. **Components must be immutable** - they only support `val` properties (no `var` properties!). Components are re-used across threads, so mutability can introduce subtle but aggravating correctness issues.
2. **`render` must be a pure function without side-effects** - if render is called with the same props and state, it should always return the same result without modifying other app state.

### Other ways to configure components

Following are some other ways you can affect your component's rendering:

- **[Common Props](../../mainconcepts/props/#common-props)** - uses the `Style` object to configure built-in behavior on a component, like click handling and background color.
- **[Tree Props](../../mainconcepts/props/#tree-props)** - provides a way to give access to contextual objects, like a theme or logging utility, to all components in a sub-tree without having to manually pass them.
- **[State](/mainconcepts/use-state.mdx)** - allows a component to persist private state across updates to the tree.
