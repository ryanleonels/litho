`useRef` is a hook that allows a component to maintain a mutable reference that doesn't trigger a re-render when updated. It returns an instance of `Ref` which has a single mutable `value` property, which should only be read/written on the UI thread.

To familiarize yourself with the concept and rules for hooks, see the [Introduction to Hooks](hooks-intro.mdx) page.

## Managing UI Thread State with `useRef`

:::caution
**Ref.value should only be read/written from the main thread.** Since there is no guarantee that a component's `render` function is executed on the main thread, it should not be accessed during the execution of `render`.

Some locations where it *is* safe to access and mutate `Ref.value`:

- `onClick` and other View events.
- `onVisible` and other visibility events.
- `useEffect` and its cleanup lambda.
:::

Appropriate use cases of `useRef` are best shown by example. Note that none of these examples read or write `useRef` off the main thread or during the execution of the main body of the component's `render` function.

### Example: Logging Seen State

In the code below, `useRef` is used to track whether we've handled the `onVisible` event previously. Updating `hasLoggedVisible.value` to `true` doesn't trigger a re-render, unlike storing and updating it via `useState`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/LogOnceComponent.kt start=start_useref_example end=end_useref_example
```

## Pairing with `useEffect`

Pairing `useRef` with `useEffect` is a common pattern. When you need to make objects created in `useEffect`, available outside of its lambda, you can store them using `useRef`. For more information on `useEffect`, see the code samples in the [useEffect](/mainconcepts/use-effect.mdx) page.
