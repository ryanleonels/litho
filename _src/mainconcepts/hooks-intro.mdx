**Definition**: *Hooks* are special functions that can persist state across renders and perform side-effects[^1] . They begin with `use` and may only be called from `render()` and other hooks. The API is heavily inspired by [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
:::

Hooks are Litho's way to enable components to persist state across renders and register for lifecycle events while remaining immutable. Litho has a suite of built in hooks whose docs you'll find in this section.

As a brief introduction, some of the most common ones you'll encounter are:

- **[useState](/mainconcepts/use-state.mdx)** - keeps track of a variable across renders.
- **[useEffect](/mainconcepts/use-effect.mdx)** - lets a component perform side-effects when it's attached or detached from the tree.
- **[useRef](/mainconcepts/use-ref.mdx)** - keeps track of a mutable reference across renders.
- **[useCached](/mainconcepts/use-cached.mdx)** - keeps track of a cached value that is expensive to calculate.

[^1]: Side-effects are operations that affect your component. Side-effects include operations such as fetch requests, subscriptions, using timers, and manually changing the DOM. Side-effects cannot occur during rendering. For more information on side-effects, see the [useEffect](use-effect.mdx) hook.

### Hooks in Practice

To demonstrate the use of hooks in practice, the component below implements a simple counter; whenever it's clicked, it increments the number of clicks and re-renders:

```kotlin {3}
class CounterComponent : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val clicks = useState { 0 }
    return Text(
        style = Style.onClick { clicks.update { c -> c + 1 } },
        text = "Clicks: ${clicks.value}")
  }
}
```

As shown in the above code, `useState` is a hook that can keep track of a variable across renders. The first time it's called it returns the initial value (`0`).  Subsequent calls return the current value of the state. For more information about state, see the [useState](/mainconcepts/use-state.mdx) page.

The identity of `useState` is just the sequence of the call within the render function. So, to add another state variable, you can just add another call to `useState`. However, this leads to some important rules about preserving the identity of hooks!

## Rules for Hooks

Hooks maintain state by using the identity of the current component along with the sequence of the call within the component. This means that in a render, the first `useState` call will maintain one piece of state, a second `useState` call will maintain another, and so on, and they'll be consistent across render passes.

As such, there are **three hooks rules** that you need to remember:

 1. Hooks can only be called from `render()` or from another hook.
 2. Hooks must not be called conditionally.
 ```kotlin
 if (something) {
   val state = useState { 1 } // INCORRECT. Called inside an if block
 }
 ```

 ```kotlin
 val cachedValue = useCached(dependendency) {
   val dynamicColor = useBinding {0} // INCORRECT. The useCached block will only be executed if the dependency changes.
   return false
 }
 ```
 3. Hook names should start with `use`.

The reasons for rules 1 and 2 are to preserve hook identity, as mentioned above. Rule 3 is just to make it easier to tell when a function has hook-like behavior.

It may prove helpful to look at some more examples, starting with the most fundamental hook: [useState](/mainconcepts/use-state.mdx)!
