## Litho Kotlin API

New Litho Kotlin API does not rely on annotation processing and code generation, its components are plain Kotlin classes, so users don't need any special IDE plugins to work with them effectively. But you still can use Litho IDE plugin to get advantage of File Templates for new Kotlin API components.

:::note
At this time, we recommend adopting the new [Litho Kotlin API](../kotlin/setup-and-intro.mdx) for your development needs.
