title: Working with Updates

:::note
Within Litho, lists are implemented using the Lazy Collection API.
:::

A Lazy Collection is updated by changing the prop/state values from which it is generated.

For correctness and performance, ensure the following:

1. [Provide Child identity](#child-identity) for all children that can be updated.
2. [Avoid unnecessary layouts](#avoiding-unnecessary-layouts) by making sure that props of children don't unnecessarily change.

The above two points are detailed in the following sections.

## Child identity

Each child in a Lazy Collection has an `id`, which is assigned by the Developer.

The `id` is used to determine how a collection changed after an update: children may have been added, removed, changed position, or had their content updated. Since an `id` is unique to a child, it is used to match children across changes to create minimal changeset and apply content update animations, and so on.

If no `id` parameter is assigned by a Developer, then it's generated using the child's position and type (this is only sufficient for static content).

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_static_id_example end=end_static_id_example
```

If the list contents can be updated, then provide unique ids that are consistent across renders.

In the following example, there are two `Text` components, one is added conditionally based on `shouldShowGreeting`, the other is unconditional. If generated ids are used, the first child is always assigned the id "Text:0", so the id would be inconsistent across renders. On Android, you can fix this by manually assigning an `id`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_child_id_example end=end_child_id_example
```

Content backed by lists should be added using the `children(..)` function: specify an `id` lambda that generates an id for each item:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_children_id_example end=end_children_id_example
```

:::caution
It is unacceptable to generate ids using a simple incrementing variable as items may change positions. Instead, use an id from the data model.
:::

**An `id` must be unique and immutable.** Breaking this contract may lead to occasional `IndexOutOfBoundsException` exceptions during layout.

## Avoiding unnecessary layouts

During a list update, if a child with the same `id` is found in the old and new lists then the Lazy Collection automatically detects if the content has changed. If an update has not occurred, the subtree will be re-used as-is, otherwise it is re-created.

Content changes are detected by checking the equality of the component's props. **If any component prop does not implement an `equals()` then it cannot be reused**. It is common for classes to not implement `equals()` such as Drawables, Lambdas, and data models. A little bit more work is required to avoid unnecessary layouts when these are used.

:::info
**The behaviour will be functionally correct by default.** If using props that do not provide an `equals()`, the UI will still use the most up-to-date prop and state values. However, there will be unnecessary layouts, which will impact performance.
:::

### Using classes without `equals()` as Props

If a component accepts a prop that does not implement an `equals()` then it will never be reused.

Consider the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_name_list_unnecessary_update end=end_name_list_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, `NameComponent` will be laid out on any update because it takes a prop of type `Name` that does not implement an `equals()`.

Unnecessary layouts can be avoided using two methods:

1. Add an `equals()` to the `Name` class, such as by making it a `data` class. This approach will not be possible if using an uncontrolled object provided by a framework.
2. Manually specify the dependencies that, if changed, should trigger an update.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_name_list_fixed end=end_name_list_fixed
```

By manually specifying the dependencies, `NameComponent` is only laid out once and re-used whenever the 'example' is updated.

Consider the following example, which uses an Android `Drawable`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_drawable_unnecessary_update end=end_drawable_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, the Text component will be unnecessarily laid out on every `render()` call because ColorDrawable does not implement an `equals()`.

Here, unnecessary layouts can be avoided using two techniques:

1. Use a drawable that implements equality such as Lithoâ€™s ComparableColorDrawable.
2. Manually specify the dependencies that, if changed, will trigger an update.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_drawable_fixed end=end_drawable_fixed
```

### Using lambdas as Props

Lambdas do not provide an `equals()`, for example, `{} == {}` is `false`. This means that using a lambda as a prop may cause unnecessary layouts.

To use a lambda in a Lazy Collection, wrap it in a `useCallback` hook.  This provides equality across layouts, allowing the component to be reused, and the lambda is guaranteed to use the latest captured prop and state values.

Consider the following example where a lambda is passed to a component:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_lambda_unnecessary_update end=end_lambda_unnecessary_update
```

In the above example, the Text will be laid out on any update to Example because the lambda props will never be equal. This can be fixed using the `useCallback` hook:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_lambda_fixed end=end_lambda_fixed
```

Consider another example, this time displaying a shopping list:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/ApplyingUpdates.kt start=start_shopping_list_example end=end_shopping_list_example
```

Each shopping list item requires a lambda to toggle a checkmark. If an unwrapped lambda was used, then no component would ever be reused as lambda does not provide an `equals()`. Instead, wrap the lambda in a `useCallback` hook. This provides equality across renders and ensure that changes are applied to the latest version of the `checkedItems` state.

### Debugging unnecessary layouts

In debug builds, `overlayRenderCount` parameter can be enabled on the Lazy Collection. This will overlay the render count onto each list item enabling the user the ability to see if items are being re-drawn when they have not changed. Simple, static items should only be rendered once. Items should only be re-rendered if their props have changed. If re-renders are being triggered by other items changing, then steps might need to be taken to deal with a prop that does not implement an `equals()`.
