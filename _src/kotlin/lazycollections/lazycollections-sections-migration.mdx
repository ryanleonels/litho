---

This page provides guidance for migrating an existing list rendered with Sections to [Lazy Collections](lazycollections.mdx).

## Advantages of migrating to Lazy Collections

The advantages of Lazy Collections over Sections include:

* No code generation.
* A cleaner API for building scrolling lists.
* Simple inline declaration (similar to a `Row` and `Column`).
* List items have direct access to the containing components props and state.
* Automatic diffing of content updates.

## Migration overview

The migration to Lazy Collections involves the following three steps:

1. Replacing the component that renders the section tree with a Lazy Collection component — see [Replace the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`](#replace-the-recyclercollectioncomponent).
2. Adding each component from the section tree as a child of the Lazy Collection — see [Migrate the `GroupSectionSpec`](#migrate-the-groupsectionspec) and [Migrate the `DataDiffSection`](#replace-the-datadiffsections).
3. Migrating any event handlers or state — see [Migrate Event Handlers](#migrate-event-handlers) and [Migrate Section State](#migrate-section-state).

Each of the above steps is detailed in the following sections.

## Replace the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`

Sections are typically rendered by a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`:

```kotlin
val component = RecyclerCollectionComponent.create(c)
  .section(...)
  .build()
```

This should be replaced with a Lazy Collection component, such as `LazyList`. For information on migrating the `RecyclerCollectionComponent`'s configuration options, see the [Layout and Styling](lazycollections-layout.mdx) page.

```kotlin
val component = LazyList {
  // Content will be added inline
}
```

:::info
Lazy Collections can only be used inside `KComponent`s. If migrating a Spec component then first convert it to a `KComponent` or implement the Lazy Collection inside a `KComponent` container.
:::

Next, migrate the content from the Section into the Lazy Collection, as detailed below.

## Migrate the `GroupSectionSpec`

A `GroupSectionSpec` is used to structure other Sections into a hierarchy. It's key part is an `onCreateChildren` method that creates and combines `SingleComponentSection`s, `DataDiffSection`s and other custom `GroupSection`s into a list of children. If `onCreateChildren`'s body is relatively simple, you can inline it inside Lazy Collection in the parent component, like in the code snippet above. In case of a complex children composition logic that benefits from encapsulation, you can replace `GroupSectionSpec` class with a custom `KComponent` that wraps Lazy Collection together with its children, and use it instead of `RecyclerCollectionComponent` in the parent component. For examples of the second approach check out the code snippets below.

## Replace the `SingleComponentSection`s

The easiest part of Sections children migration is dealing with `SingleComponentSection`s. The following `GroupSectionSpec` renders two components as `SingleComponentSection`s:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/SimpleGroupSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

The component from each `SingleComponentSection` should be added as a child to the Lazy Collection. Lazy Collections support both Kotlin API components and Spec children. `SingleComponentSection` config options are available as parameters on `child` method, such as `isSticky`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_simple_group end=end_simple_group
```

Next, consider a list rendered with a `DataDiffSection`.

## Replace the `DataDiffSection`s

A `DataDiffSection` is used to render a collection of homogeneous data. This type of Section can be defined as a child in a `GroupSectionSpec`, or directly passed to a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`. It requires the following event handlers:

* `renderEventHandler` - determines how to render a list item.
* `onCheckIsSameItemEventHandler` - determines if items have the same identity.
* `onCheckIsSameContentEventHandler` - determines if items have updated content.

Consider the following `GroupSectionSpec` that contains a `DataDiffSection` to render a list of the following type:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ListSectionSpec.kt start=start_data_type end=end_data_type
```

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ListSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

A component for each list item should be added to the Lazy Collection as a child. It's the same component that is passed to the `component` parameter during `ComponentRenderInfo` creation in `RenderEvent` handler method.

The child `id` parameter should be unique and consistent across re-renders and will likely be the value that is compared in `onCheckIsSameItem`. See the [guidelines for child ids](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx#child-identity).

It is not necessary to migrate the checks from `onCheckIsSameContent` as the Lazy Collection will automatically compare the child component props. However, additional steps may be required to eliminate unnecessary layouts if child takes props that do not provide an `equals()`. For more information, see the [Avoiding Unnecessary Layouts](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx##avoiding-unecessary-layouts) page.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_list end=end_list
```

## Migrate Event Handlers

Event handlers that are defined as `@OnEvent` functions (such as visibility or click handling) can be passed as lambdas to the appropriate `Style` functions. Note that using lambdas as props could cause [unnecessary updates](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx#using-lambdas-as-props), so they should be wrapped in a `useCallback` hook.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/EventHandlerSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Migrating the above Section to a Lazy Collection's yields:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_event_handler end=end_event_handler
```

## Migrate Section State

State managed by a `Section` should be moved into the component that manages the Lazy Collection. It may be beneficial to consider defining the Lazy Collection inside a dedicated `KComponent` so that it can maintain its own state.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/StateSectionSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Migrating the above Section to a Lazy Collection yields the following:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/SectionsMigrations.kt start=start_state end=end_state
```
