:::note
Lazy Collections are a Kotlin-only API. Within Litho, lists are implemented using the Lazy Collection API.

For Java use, or docs on the older Java codegen-based Sections API, see [Sections Basics](../../sections/start.mdx) in the 'Codegen APIs' section.

## Lazy Collection basics

**Lazy Collections** are components that can efficiently render a scrollable list of child components using Android's `RecyclerView`. The 'lazy' in the name refers to the fact that not all children need to be immediately resolved to put content on the screen. Instead, a Lazy Collection maintains a window of resolved children, which is dynamically updated while scrolling.

Lazy Collections are available as follows:

* [LazyList](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyList.kt)
* [LazyGrid](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyGrid.kt)
* [LazyStaggeredGrid](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/LazyStaggeredGrid.kt)

The following code creates a `LazyList` and adds a child `Text` component for each list item.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/FriendsCollectionKComponent.kt start=start_lazy_list_example end=end_lazy_list_example
```

### Adding children

An important difference from adding children in a normal container like `Column` is that each child needs a consistent and unique id. This id is used to detect moves, insertions, deletions, and updates across render passes.

There are two primary ways to add children to a Lazy Collection:

* `child` - takes a component and an *optional* `id` parameter - if `id` is null or not provided, an id will be generated based on the sequence and type of this child in the list (i.e. 'third Text'). This auto-generated id may be fine, but an explicit one is safer!
* `children` - takes a lambda mapping a list of data to a list of components and a *mandatory* `id` function that maps data to an id for that component.

For more information on how to make sure updates are applied to your Lazy List correctly and efficiently, see the [Working with Updates docs](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx).

## Why not just use `Column` or `Row`?

A simple, but non-scalable approach to render a list of components is to use a `Column` or `Row` container:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/FriendsCollectionKComponent.kt start=start_column_example end=end_column_example
```

The above component creates a `Column` and adds a child `Text` component for each friend: it's made scrollable by wrapping it in a `VerticalScroll`.

**This approach is inefficient and inflexible when dealing with many items.**

Consider a user with 100 friends. During the resolution of the `Column`, the associated 100 `Text` components would also be resolved despite only a few being visible on the screen initially. Additionally, if one of the names was updated or changed position, all 100 `Text` components would be resolved again.

A more efficient and flexible approach is to use Lazy Collections.

## Documentation content

The documentation for lists includes the following pages:

* [Layout and Styling](lazycollections-layout.mdx) - how to customize the rendering of a list.
* [Interactions](lazycollections-interactions.mdx) - how to interact with and listen to events on a list.
* [Working with Updates](lazycollections-working-with-updates.mdx) - how to ensure a list handles updates efficiently.
* [Sections Migration Guide](lazycollections-sections-migration.mdx) - guidance for migrating an existing list rendered with Sections to Lazy Collections.
