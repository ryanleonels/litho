### Prerequisites

Before reading this page, you may find it helpful to review the following sections of the Tutorial:

* [Setting up the Project](../tutorial/project-setup.mdx) - the required settings and dependencies to add Litho to your project.
* [Component and Props](../tutorial/first-components.md) - learn the basic Litho building blocks and create a component that uses props.
* [Introducing Layout](../tutorial/introducing-layout.md) - become familiar with building layouts using Flexbox.

## Adopting Litho in your app

Using Litho in a new surface is fairly straightforward: you can put a `LithoView` at the root of your new `Fragment` or `Activity` and start writing your components.
However, adopting Litho within an existing surface needs to be done more incrementally and can require a bit more thought.

Litho components can interoperate with `View`s in the same App or even on the same screen, so you can migrate `View`-based screen to Litho incrementally and maintain a hybrid Component-View UI.

There are two common strategies for incrementally migrating to Litho: [Bottom Up](#bottom-up) and [Top-down](#top-down), as detailed in the following sub-sections.

Let's use the simple UI shown below as an example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/images/litho-compound-component.png')} alt='litho-compound-component'/>

This is how the XML/`View` implementation of the above UI could look like:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>XML</th>
  <th>View</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>

```xml
<!-- my_custom_layout.xml -->
<LinearLayout
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content">
  <ImageView
      android:layout_width="100dp"
      android:layout_height="100dp"
      android:src="@drawable/ic_launcher"/>
  <TextView
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_gravity="center_vertical"
      android:text="Hello there"/>
</LinearLayout>
```
</td><td>

```kotlin
class MyCustomLayout @JvmOverloads constructor(
    context: Context,
    attrs: AttributeSet? = null
) : LinearLayout(context, attrs) {
  init {
    orientation = HORIZONTAL
    layoutParams = LayoutParams(
        MATCH_PARENT,
        WRAP_CONTENT
    )

    addView(
        ImageView(context).apply {
          layoutParams = LayoutParams(
              100.dpToPx,
              100.dpToPx)
          setImageResource(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        }
    )

    addView(
        TextView(context).apply {
          layoutParams = LayoutParams(
              WRAP_CONTENT,
              WRAP_CONTENT).apply {
            gravity = CENTER_VERTICAL
          }
          text = "Hello there"
        }
    )
  }
}
```

</td></tr>
</table>

### Bottom-up

With the bottom-up approach, you break down the UI into smaller pieces that can be converted incrementally. The `View` or `ViewGroup` in the original implementation is replaced by a `LithoView` that you attach as child to the root `ViewGroup` of your UI.

In the example component above, you can identify two UI blocks, which can be converted independently into two Litho components: Image and Text

Litho provides [a library of widget components](../widgets/builtin-widgets.mdx), which you can immediately start using. If your app has a custom design system that implements custom views for primitives such as `Button`, `Text` or `Image`, you can start by creating [Primitive Components)](../mainconcepts/primitivecomponents/overview.mdx) for them first; you can also reuse these components across the app to convert multiple screens to Litho.

Once you've completed the conversion of the `View`s, you can coalesce all the individual Primitive Components into a single [KComponent](basics.mdx) and use one `LithoView` as the root of the UI.

Here is an example showing how the example component could be implemented with a bottom-up:

```kotlin
class MyCustomComponent : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    return Row {
      child(
          Image(
              drawable = drawableRes(R.drawable.ic_launcher),
              style = Style.width(100.dp).height(100.dp))
      )
      child(
          Text(
              text = "Hello there",
              style = Style.alignSelf(YogaAlign.CENTER))
      )
    }
  }
}
```

It's recommended to use the bottom-approach because this way you can use the full potential of Litho and its performance optimisations such as:

 - Incremental mount
 - View flattening
 - Moving work to background thread
 - View/Drawable pooling and preallocation
 - Granular UI updates

### Top-down

With the top-down approach, you replace the root `ViewGroup` of your UI with a `LithoView` and wrap the root `View` representing the UI into a [Primitive Component()](../mainconcepts/primitivecomponents/overview.mdx). As you convert smaller parts of the UI into Components, you extract them out of the Primitive Component and into individual `LithoView`s.

Here is how the example component could be implemented with the top-down approach:
```kotlin
class MyCustomComponent : PrimitiveComponent() {
  override fun PrimitiveComponentScope.render(): LithoPrimitive {
    return LithoPrimitive(
        layoutBehavior = MyCustomLayoutBehavior,
        mountBehavior = MountBehavior(ALLOCATOR) {},
        style = null)
  }
}

private val ALLOCATOR: ViewAllocator<LinearLayout> =
    ViewAllocator { context ->
      // Either instantiate the View
      MyCustomLayout(context) as LinearLayout
      // or inflate the XML
      LayoutInflater.from(context)
          .inflate(
              R.layout.my_custom_layout,
              null
          ) as LinearLayout
    }

private object MyCustomLayoutBehavior : LayoutBehavior {
  override fun LayoutScope.layout(
      sizeConstraints: SizeConstraints
  ): PrimitiveLayoutResult {
    val content = ALLOCATOR.createContent(androidContext)
    content.measure(
        sizeConstraints.toWidthSpec(),
        sizeConstraints.toHeightSpec()
    )

    return PrimitiveLayoutResult(
        width = max(sizeConstraints.minWidth, content.measuredWidth),
        height = max(sizeConstraints.minHeight, content.measuredHeight))
  }
}
```

This may be a good starting point, and in many cases it will be faster to implement than the bottom-up approach, especially when wrapping complex `View`s containing lots of internal logic. However, components implemented with the top-down approach won't be as performant as the ones implemented with the bottom-up approach, because Litho won't be able to perform all of the available optimizations on components implemented with the top-down approach. For example:

 - Less work can be moved to background thread - when the logic to initialise the `View` is encapsulated inside the `View`, then it is necessary to do it on the main thread.
 - Possible corretness issues - mixing composite `View`s and component wrappers can be prone to accidental mutations of the internal `View` state, causing the component and `View` state to diverge.

Litho will still apply the following optimizations making the wrapped `View`s more performant compared to not using Litho at all:

 - Incremental Mount
 - Pooling and preallocation

Some scenarios when the top-down approach is suitable include:

- Using Litho for the architecture of your surface and for writing new features, but existing `View`s might not be immediately converted to Litho.
- Converting a list surface to [Sections](../sections/start.mdx). The root of the surface is a `LithoView` rendering a `RecyclerCollectionComponent`, while the individual list items can be either `Views` or Litho Components. You can leverage the Litho Lists API for features such as asynchronous data diffing or granular `RecyclerView.Adapter` updates before converting the entire UI to Litho.

### More complex example

Consider the following UI as an example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/images/post-breakdown.png')} alt='post-breakdown'/>

You can identify three UI blocks, which can be converted independently into three Litho Components:

 - Header
 - Media
 - Footer

You'll have three `LithoView`s in your UI to render the components.

These components will be composed of smaller widgets such as `Text` or `Image`, similar to how `ViewGroup`s arrange smaller `View`s.

Just like in the simpler example above - when the incremental conversion is complete, the individual Primitive Components can be merged into a single [KComponent](basics.mdx).

With the top-down approach, you'd replace the root `ViewGroup` of your UI with a `LithoView` and wrap the root `View` representing the UI into a [Primitive Component()](../mainconcepts/primitivecomponents/overview.mdx). As you convert smaller parts of the UI into Components, you extract them out of the Primitive Component and into individual `LithoView`s.
