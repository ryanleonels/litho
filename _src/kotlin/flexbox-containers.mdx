This page covers how to convert existing code from the Spec API to the Kotlin API.

For the main Flexbox documentation, refer to the [Layout System with Flexbox](mainconcepts/flexbox-yoga.mdx) page.

## Rows and Columns, revisited

As with the Spec API, `Row` and `Column` are the primary layout containers used in the Kotlin API.

### Differences between the Kotlin API and the Spec API

When using `Row` and `Column`, there are a few important differences between the Spec API and the Kotlin API:

1. **Props of Rows and Columns** - props that configure the `Row`/`Column` itself, like `alignItems` or `justifyContent`, now appear as props directly on the container component. In this way, there is no difference from setting props on any other component.
2. **Common Props** - props that configure a particular child's positioning within the context of a `Row`/`Column`, like `alignSelf` or `flex`, now appear with other [common props](basics.mdx#common-props) on the `Style` passed to that child. This is akin to `LayoutParams` in vanilla Android in that they must be able to go on any component and are read by the parent.
3. **Children** - children are added within a trailing lambda using the `child()` calls.

The following snippet illustrates the points above:

 ```kotlin
  Column(alignItems = YogaAlign.CENTER, style = Style.padding(all = 8.dp)) {
    child(Text(text = "Foo", style = Style.flex(grow = 1f)))
    child(Text(text = "Bar"))
  }
 ```

## Migrating from the Spec API

:::note Why are Layout Props Now Defined in Two Different Ways?

Without code-generated builders, Litho had to make a distinction between props of the container itself and common props that can be set on children of the container.

For example, `alignItems` configures the default alignment for children in this container and is only valid on a flexbox container. It's set like a normal component prop on `Row`/`Column`.

On the other hand, `alignSelf` can be respected on any child of a container, whether it's a Text, a Switch, or some custom Component: it's therefore exposed as a common prop via `Style`.

The benefit of this is that developers can now statically verify all required props are set instead of verifying at runtime (as well as not rely on codegen!).

### Flexbox properties cheatsheet

The following table helps to identify whether to set a layout property directly on the `Row`/`Column` or on the `Style`:

| Flexbox Property   | Configures a Specific Child? | Example Kotlin API Usage                   |
| :--                | :-:                          | :--                                        |
| `justifyContent`   | No                           | `Row(justifyContent = YogaJustify.CENTER)` |
| `alignContent`     | No                           | `Row(alignContent = YogaAlign.CENTER)`     |
| `alignItems`       | No                           | `Row(alignItems = YogaAlign.CENTER)`       |
| `wrap`             | No                           | `Row(wrap = YogaWrap.NO_WRAP)`             |
| `alignSelf`        | Yes                          | `Style.alignSelf(YogaAlign.CENTER)`        |
| `flexBasis`        | Yes                          | `Style.flex(basis = 8.dp)`                 |
| `flexBasisPercent` | Yes                          | `Style.flex(basisPercent = 25f)`           |
| `flexGrow`         | Yes                          | `Style.flex(grow = 1f)`                    |
| `flexShrink`       | Yes                          | `Style.flex(shrink = 1f)`                  |
| `margin`           | Yes                          | `Style.margin(8.dp)`                       |
| `padding`          | Yes                          | `Style.padding(8.dp)`                      |
| `width`            | Yes                          | `Style.width(50.dp)`                       |
| `height`           | Yes                          | `Style.height(50.dp)`                      |

:::note
A property is set via `Style` if and only if it configures a specific child!

### Example migration

Below is an example of a simple `Component` using various layout properties, converted to an equivalent KComponent:

<Tabs
  groupId="flexbox"
  defaultValue="kotlin_flexbox"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin API', value: 'kotlin_flexbox'},
    {label: 'Spec API', value: 'java_flexbox'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin_flexbox">

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/FlexboxComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java_flexbox">

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/onboarding/JavaApiComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
