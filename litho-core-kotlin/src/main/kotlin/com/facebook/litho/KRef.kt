/**
 * Declares a mutable, main-thread confined reference that will be persisted across renders with an
 * initial value provided by the initializer. It's similar to [useState], except that the returned
 * reference is mutable and updating it will *not* cause a re-render.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: It's only safe to read/write the [Ref]'s value on the main thread!
 *
 * An example of a safe way to use `useRef` is to store an Animator that is started/stopped from
 * [useEffect] or a click event, both of which run on the UI thread.
