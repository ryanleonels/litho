:::note
Dynamic props are properties that are applied directly to a `View` or `Drawable`. They are updated without computing a layout or remounting. This makes them efficient for use in animations or other dynamic UIs. Dynamic props are initialised and updated using [DynamicValue](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/DynamicValue.html).
:::

## `DynamicValue`

In `KComponents`, a `DynamicValue` can be created using `useBinding()`. You can then keep a reference to the `DynamicValue` and use it to directly set values (such as in a callback or an `Animator`). Use the `set()` function to set new values from the main thread.

:::caution
`DynamicValue`s should only be updated on the main thread.
:::

## Common dynamic props

The dynamic properties that are available for all `Component`s are:

* Alpha
* Scale X/Y
* Translation X/Y
* Background Color
* Foreground Color
* Rotation
* Elevation (from Lollipop and above)

For `KComponent`s they should be applied as a `Style` item:

```kotlin
MyKComponent(style = Style.alpha(dynamicAlpha))
```

The `DynamicValue` can be updated by calling its [set()](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/DynamicValue.html#set-T-) function.

The following code sample shows a `Component` that renders a square in the middle of the screen. The `alpha` and `scale` props have been set to the `DynamicValue`s, which are updated by two `SeekBar`s.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/CommonDynamicPropsKComponent.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

The following short animation illustrates the component in action.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/common_dynamic_props.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

To see how other common dynamic props can be modified, see the [All Common Dynamic Props](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/AllCommonDynamicPropsKComponent.kt) example in the Sample app, which is illustrated in the following animation.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/all_dynamic_props.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

## Custom dynamic drops for `PrimitiveComponent`

Dynamic Mount Props property types enable the value of the property, on the content mounted by the `PrimitiveComponent`, to be updated without triggering a new layout (such as when animating the text colour of a Text component).

### `bindDynamic` - dynamic props in practice

To illustrate the use of `bindDynamic` in practice, you will implement a simple `ImageViewComponent` that will have `background`, `rotation` and `scale` properties animated, based on the `SeekBar` value.

Start off by defining each `DynamicValue` by using the `useBinding` hook and attaching it to the `SeekBar.onProgressChanged` callback that will change them accordingly:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/bindto/PrimitiveBindToExampleComponent.kt start=start_bindTo_seekbar_code end=end_bindTo_seekbar_code
```

The `PrimitiveComponent`, `ImageViewComponent`, will be defined as a child below the `SeekBar` children in the `render()` function and will take each `DynamicValue` as a constructor parameter:
```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/bindto/PrimitiveBindToExampleComponent.kt start=start_bindTo_imagecomponent_def end=end_bindTo_imagecomponent_def
```
```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=start_bindTo_imagecomponent_code end=end_bindTo_imagecomponent_code
```

Now, in the `PrimitiveComponent.render()` call, use the `bindDynamic` method to bind each `DynamicValue` to the `ImageView` properties.

There are two ways of using `bindDynamic`:

1. The simpler way is to create a binding between the `DynamicValue` and function reference to the setter of the property.
   * The setter will be invoked for every update of the `DynamicValue`.
1. The more complex binding can be achieved by using a lambda and accessing the view directly, as shown in the following snippet.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/bindto/ImageViewComponent.kt start=start_bindTo_binding_code end=end_bindTo_binding_code
```

The following short video shows the `bindDynamic` in action:

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/bindToAPI.mov")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

### Key points for the `bindDynamic`

* A `DynamicValue` has to be bound to the `PrimitiveComponent` in `MountConfigurationScope` which is passed as a trailing lambda to `MountBehavior`.
* A `PrimitiveComponent` can have several dynamic props.
* It is possible to automatically unbind the `DynamicValue` after `unmount()` is called by setting the default value or using `onUnbindDynamic {}` block.

## Animating dynamic props

Dynamic props values can be used with Android Animators to create custom animations. The following example uses a [`ValueAnimator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ValueAnimator) to animate the dynamic value `time`, defined in the previous value.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/dynamicprops/AnimateDynamicPropsKComponent.kt  start=start_example end=end_example
```

A `DynamicValue` is used to represent time.  This is passed to the `Component` as a prop and kept as a reference to it so it can be updated. In a click event, a `ValueAnimator` is set up that updates the time `DynamicValue` each frame (see the following animation). The `ValueAnimator` is stored in a reference so that it can be cancelled if necessary.

<video loop="true" autoplay="true" class="video" width="100%" height="500px" muted="true">
  <source type="video/webm" src={useBaseUrl("/videos/custom_prop_animation.webm")}></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

For more examples of creating Animations using Common Dynamic Props, see the [Animations Cook Book](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/animations/animationcookbook) in the Sample App.
