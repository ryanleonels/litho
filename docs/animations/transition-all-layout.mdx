The [`Transition.allLayout()`](pathname:///javadoc/com/facebook/litho/Transition.html#allLayout--) method enables all layout changes to be easily animated without having to assign `transitionKey`s to all components:

```kotlin
useTransition(Transition.allLayout().animator(ANIMATOR))
```

The following key points apply to `Transition.allLayout()`:

1. Targets `AnimatedProperty.X`, `Y`, `HEIGHT` and `WIDTH` of all components present in the layout tree.
2. Can be used to define [Change](transition-types.mdx#change-transitions) transitions only. To define the [Appear](transition-types.mdx#appear-transitions) and [Disappear](transition-types.mdx#disappear-transitions) transitions, `transitionKey`s still need to be assigned.
3. Could be used as a part of more [complex choreography](transition-choreography.mdx).

The following example can be found in `Litho Sample App -> API Demos -> Animated Badge`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/animatedbadge/AnimatedBadgeKotlin.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

The following animation shows the above 'AnimatedBadge' in action.
