title: Compatibility with Custom Views

This page details how to migrate custom Views to Litho Components when the existing widgets cannot be composed to achieve the UI you want.

Some cases when you might need this migration include:

* Custom design systems with specialised widgets or measuring logic.
* Displaying Video, for which Litho doesn't provide a widget.
* Migrating a surface to Litho incrementally when you need to maintain a hybrid View-Component UI.

## Views to Components

To learn how you can bridge a custom View or Drawable to a Component, follow the [Mount Specs](../codegen/mount-specs.md) page (in the Codege APIs secton).

:::info
Bridging Views into Components is currently only supported through the Codegen MountSpec API.
:::

You can compose MountSpec Components as you would compose any other KComponents, but they are instantiated using the Codegen Components Builder pattern.
Consider the following MountSpec Component:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/onboarding/viewcompat/CircularImageSpec.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

You can create an instance of `CircularImage` in the `render()` method of a KComponent using its Builder:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/onboarding/viewcompat/RootComponentUsingBuilder.kt start=start_use_mount_spec end=end_use_mount_spec
```

## Codegen component wrappers

A common pattern for using Codegen MountSpec Components in KComponents is to wrap them in a ResourcesScope extension function and call that instead of the Builder to create the Component.

This gives uniformity to your KComponent code as well as enabling you to seamlessly convert the Codegen MountSpec Components to a Kotlin DSL API when it becomes available without updating the existing usages.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/onboarding/viewcompat/KotlinWrappers.kt start=start_kwrapper end=end_kwrapper
```

After creating the wrapper, you can use a `CircularImage` Component as follows:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/onboarding/viewcompat/RootComponentUsingWrapper.kt start=start_use_mount_spec end=end_use_mount_spec
```
