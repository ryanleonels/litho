:::note
Within Litho, lists are implemented using the Lazy Collection API.

## Clicking items

Clicking items in the Lazy Collection can be done by simply adding `Style.onClick` to children. 

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/gettingstarted/BasicList.kt start=start_list_clicking_example end=end_list_clicking_example
```

## Scrolling the Lazy Collection

Scrolling the Lazy Collection by a given distance, or to a child with a given index/id, is a two-step process:

1. Create a `LazyCollectionController` and attach it to the Lazy Collection via the `lazyCollectionController` parameter. Note that it should be defined in a `useState` hook.
2. Use one of the `LazyCollectionController`’s scroll functions.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/Interactions.kt start=start_scrolling_example end=end_scrolling_example
```

## Responding to scroll events

An [OnNearCallback](https://github.com/facebook/litho/blob/master/litho-widget-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/widget/collection/OnNearCallback.kt) can be applied to the Lazy Collection's `onNearEnd` parameter, or a child's `onNearViewport` parameter.

For example, `onNearEnd = OnNearCallback(offset = 10) { /* callback */ }`.

Where:

* `onNearEnd` is invoked when the Lazy Collection is scrolled to the last position or is scrolled within `offset` items away.
* `onNearViewport` is invoked when the child enters the viewport or is `offset` items away.

For more complex scroll handling (such as for animations), you can access the `RecyclerView` directly via a `LazyCollectionController` and use a `RecyclerView.OnScrollListener` to receive callbacks during scroll. To use this technique, take the following steps:

1. Create a `LazyCollectionController` and attach it to the Lazy Collection via the `lazyCollectionController` parameter. Note that it should be defined in a `useState` hook.
2. Access the `RecyclerView` via `LazyCollectionController.recyclerView`
3. Add a custom `OnScrollListener` using `RecyclerView.addOnScrollListener(..)`

:::note
It is currently unsafe to trigger a scroll event inside a `useEffect` callback as it will be invoked before the Lazy Collection's contents have been mounted.
To trigger a scroll immediately on entering a screen, use the `LazyCollection`'s `onDataBound` callback.

## Paging

Lists of data are often retrieved from the server in pages; additional data is requested only if the user scrolls. To achieve this behaviour, add a callback to the Lazy Collection’s `onNearEnd` parameter that fetches more data. This will be triggered when the Lazy Collection is scrolled near to the end. Optionally, add a request indicator to the bottom of the list.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/PaginationCollectionKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## Pull to refresh

To implement the 'pull to refresh' behaviour, provide a callback to the Lazy Collection's `onPullToRefresh` parameter. This callback will be responsible for fetching fresh data.

To dismiss the refreshing indicator, take the following two steps:

1. Create a `LazyCollectionController` and attach it to the Lazy Collection via the `lazyCollectionController` parameter. Note that it should be defined in a `useState` hook.
2. Call `LazyCollectionController.setRefreshing(false)`.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/collection/Interactions.kt start=start_pull_to_refresh_example end=end_pull_to_refresh_example
```
