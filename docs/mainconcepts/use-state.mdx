`useState` is a hook that allows a component to persist and update a single value across renders and is the most common hook you'll encounter.

To familiarize yourself with the concept and rules for hooks, see the [Introduction to Hooks](hooks-intro.mdx) page.

## Declaring and Using State

Declare state with `useState`, passing an initial value. `useState` will always return a `State<T>` holding whatever the current value of that state is. On the first render, this is the initial value, however in subsequent renders it will include any updates that have been commited for that state variable.

The following code shows an example of a component that renders a counter that increments when it is clicked. `useState` is used to track the value of that counter over time:

```kotlin {3,6}
class CounterComponent : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val clicks = useState { 0 }
    return Text(
        style = Style.onClick { clicks.update { c -> c + 1 } },
        text = "Clicks: ${clicks.value}")
  }
}
```

## Updating State

:::note
`update` causes the re-render to be **async by default**. If you need to perform a synchronous state update (that is, one which will cause a re-render synchronously on the current thread), use `updateSync`.
:::

To update state, use the `update` method on the `State<T>` returned from `useState`. This will trigger a render pass with the new state value:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/CheckboxComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

### Value vs. Lambda variants

`update` and `updateSync` have two variants:

1. **Value variant** - takes a determined value, such as `myState.update(1)`.
2. **Lambda variant** - takes a lambda receiving the old value which can be used to compute a new value, such as `myState.update { c -> c + 1 }`.

**The basic rule of thumb is: use the lambda variant when you need to perform an update that depends on the old state value.** This is because `value` on `State` is a snapshot of that state for the current render and may not reflect any renders that have occurred since (or are currently occuring on other threads).

For example, if your state update increments a counter, then using the function version of `update` with `count -> count + 1` enables you to account for updates that are in flight but not yet applied (such as if the user has tapped a button triggering the update multiple times in succession).

## Using state in child components

*Avoid passing a State directly to the child component*. Instead, pass a lambda to the child which it can invoke to notify the parent to update the state:

```kotlin {3,5} file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/state/StateParentChildComponent.kt start=start_example_parent end=end_example_parent
```

And then in the child component:

```kotlin {1,4} file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/state/ChildComponent.kt start=start_example_child end=end_example_child
```

## Batching Updates

Litho has an internal mechanism where it batches state updates to avoid the scenario of doing one layout re-calculation per state update (and corresponding mount) and, therefore
become more performant.

Internally, Litho achieves this by leveraging the lifecycle of the `Choreographer` API and how it breaks down its different work phases. Whenever the `Choregrapher` receives a VSYNC signal,
it starts a cycle to prepare the next Frame. In this cycle, it goes through 3 main phases:

1. Input handling
2. Animation (which layouts, measures, and draws)
3. Traversals

When Litho enqueues a new state update, it will schedule its layout calculation on the `Choreographer`'s next animation phase. This way, any subsequent state update enqueued before the next animation phase will
be taken into account in the following layout calculation (and not re-schedule any more work).
