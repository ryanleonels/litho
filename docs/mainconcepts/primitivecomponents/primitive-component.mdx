title: Creating a Primitive Component
---

Primitive Components can be used to render views or drawables on the screen.

## Comparison with KComponents

There are several similarities between Primitive Components and [KComponents](/mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx):

* They both consist of a render function that can use the component's [props](../props.mdx) and [hooks](../hooks-intro.mdx).
* As with KComponents, Primitive Components are subject to [rules](../components-basics.mdx/#rules-for-components) for their use.
* Just like KComponents, Primitive Components can be configured using common props and state.

## Creating a Primitive Component

The following example shows a Primitive Component that creates an `ImageView` to be rendered on the screen.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/primitives/SimpleImageViewPrimitiveComponent.kt start=start_image_primitive_component_example end=end_image_primitive_component_example
```

:::note
The above example explicitly creates a `Primitive` object. But for convenience, you can also pass `layoutBehavior` and `mountBehavior` directly to `LithoPrimitive`.
:::

A Primitive represents a reusable unit responsible for hosting the logic to create, measure, and bind the content that the Primitive Component will render. For more information, see the [Lifecycle of a Primitive Component](primitive.mdx) page.

As can be seen from the above example, the `render()` function returns a `LithoPrimitive` that contains:

* A `Primitive` object that describes a primitive to be rendered
* A `style` object that is applied to the primitive component.

:::note
The `render()` method can be invoked from multiple threads. You should **not** assume it can only be called from the main thread. The implementation of render should not cause side-effects; essentially, it acts like a pure function.
