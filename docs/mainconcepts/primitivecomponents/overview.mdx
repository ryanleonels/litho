Primitive Components are used to render views or drawables and are a replacement for the old Specs API-based [Mount Specs](../../codegen/mount-specs.md). Here, *Mount* refers to the operation performed by all components in a layout tree to extract their rendered state (a `View` or a `Drawable`) to be displayed.

Primitive Components should only be created when you need to integrate your own views/drawables with Litho.

The Primitive Components section contains the following pages:

* [Creating a Primitive Component](primitive-component.mdx) - details how to create a Primitive Component responsible for rendering a View or Drawable. Also, compares Primitive Components with KComponents.
* [Lifecycle of a Primitive](primitive.mdx) - covers the purpose and creation of a Primitive in addition to how to create and mount its content.
* [Measuring](primitive-measuring.mdx) - shows different strategies to measure the content the Primitive Component will render.
* [Controllers Pattern](primitive-controllers.mdx) - illustrates the use of controllers by implementing a simple TimePicker that shows an arbitrary time.
* [Content Pooling](primitive-preallocation.mdx) - details a strategy that can be used to populate the content pools to optimise first mount performance.
* [Tracing](primitive-tracing.mdx) - shows how to customize [performance tracing](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing) information for Primitive Components.

Information and step-by-step explanations of how to migrate existing MountSpec components to Primitive Components can be found in [Migrating MountSpecs](../../kotlin/migrating-from-mountspecs-to-primitives.mdx) page.
