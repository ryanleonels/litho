The [Components](components-basics.mdx) page details how to declare a component and its **props** as standard `val` properties. This page covers two more ways for a parent component to configure its children with props: [Common props](#common-props) and [Tree props](#tree-props).

## Common Props

:::note
A common prop is one of a set of properties that can be applied to any primitive component.
:::

Common props are supported by all primitive components. They include View properties like `onClick` and `background`, visibility events like `onVisible`, as well as layout parameters like `margin`.

Common props are specified using the `Style` API, which enables one or more common props to be chained together into a Style object that is passed to the components as a prop, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
val style = Style.margin(all = 4.px)
    .backgroundColor(Color.RED)
    .viewTag("my_view")
```

For a component to be configured with a Style, it should declare a Style prop (such as `val style: Style? = null`). It should then pass that Style object to one of the components it renders to, usually the root component it returns from `render`. In this way, the Style will eventually end up on a primitive component (for example, `Text` or `Row)`. All common props end up being materialized by primitive components, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/HelloComponent.kt start=start_styled_example end=end_styled_example
```

### Combining a Style from above with a local Style

The following 'more advanced' example shows how you can combine a Style taken from above with the Style the component itself wants to define:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ChildStylesExample.kt start=start_combine_style_example end=end_combine_style_example
```

### Working with Style

In the above example, you may have noticed the use of `+` to combine the Style passed from `OuterTextComponent` and the styles that `InnerTextComponent` defines. The `+` operator combines two Styles into a single Style without mutating either:

```kotlin
val alphaStyle = Style.alpha(1f)
val combinedStyle = alphaStyle + Style.padding(all = 8.dp).margin(all = 8.dp)

// Result:
//   alphaStyle: (alpha: 1f)
//   combinedStyle: (alpha: 1f) <- (padding-all: 8.dp) <- (margin-all: 8.dp)
```

Note that ordering around `+` matters: if a Style property is defined twice, the **last** definition takes precendence:

```kotlin
val alphaStyle = Style.alpha(1f)
val combinedStyle = alphaStyle + Style.padding(all = 8.dp).alpha(.5f)

// Result:
//   combinedStyle will apply padding of 8.dp and alpha of .5f
```

Generally, `Style` objects are immutable: any time you combine styles or add new properties to a style, you get a new `Style` instance that contains all the properties of the previous style plus the new properties.

### Java - Kotlin compatibility

If you need to pass down a style from a Java class to a Kotlin component, use `StyleCompat`:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/OuterStyleComponentSpec.java start=start_combine_style_outer_example end=end_combine_style_outer_example
```

For passing style from Kotlin code to a Java Spec component, you can use `.kotlinStyle()`, which is equivalent to setting all the common props the `Style` defines:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ChildStylesExample.kt start=start_combine_java_kotlin_style_example end=end_combine_java_kotlin_style_example
```

## Tree Props

:::note
A tree prop is a special type of prop that is transparently passed from a parent component to its children.
:::

A TreeProp is a special type of prop which is transparently passed from a parent component to its children. It provides a convenient way to share contextual data or utilities in a tree without having to explicitly pass `val` properties to every component in your hierarchy.

### Declaring a Tree Prop

In order to declare a TreeProp you need to use `TreePropProvider`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/treeprops/TreePropsExampleComponent.kt start=declaring_tree_prop_start end=declaring_tree_prop_end
```

:::note
You can only declare one TreeProp for any one given type. If a child of ParentComponent also defines a TreeProp of the given type, it will override the value of that TreeProp for all its children (but not for itself).
:::

### Using a Tree Prop

The child component can access the TreeProp value through a `ComponentScope.getTreeProp<>()` method that has the same type that was declared in the parents `TreePropProvider` call:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/treeprops/TreePropsChildComponent.kt start=using_tree_prop_start end=using_tree_prop_end
```

### When to Use Tree Props

Tree Props are powerful, but if overused, they can make your component code more difficult to understand. The best practice is to only use tree props for properties that the whole tree needs to know about (such as theming information or loggers) and not just as a more convenient way to get props to the leaves of a tree of components.
