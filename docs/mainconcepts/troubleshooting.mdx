title: Flexbox Troubleshooting
---

A few issues may be encountered while using flexbox. This section discusses the more common of those issues, which may prove useful when debugging and finding issues in layout.

For debugging, the [Flipper layout inspector plugin](/docs/debugging/debugging-tips#layout-inspector-plugin) can be used to see the component hierarchy, and the flex properties can be updated in the plugin itself to understand how it affects layout.

Another tool that can be used for understanding and playing around with flexbox properties is [Yoga Playground](https://yogalayout.com/playground).

## Why is my text truncated?

One common problem is that there is not enough space for content to be visible on the screen and therefore text gets truncated.
The default value of `flexShrink` is `1.0f`. So, if there is not enough space available for the text to render completely then text will shrink and and will be shown truncated on the screen. Changing the `flexShrink` value to `0` makes sure that text component is not shrinked.

Imagine there are two `Text` components in a `Row`. If no flex properties are defined on either of the `Text` components, then they both will take equal space and text will be truncated if text is too long to fit into available space.
Now, if `flexShrink = 0f` is added to the first `Text`, then it won't shrink and take up the whole space to render itself completely; the second `Text` will take up the remaining space.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/flexbox/TextInRow.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

However, if the second `Text` is still truncated, based on the requirements, then either make it multiline or display the two `Text`s inside a `Column`.

Another scenario where text can get truncated is if there is an exact width and height defined on a sibling component, which is taking up all the available space and not allowing other children to grow.
In this case, either remove the exact `width`/`height` defined so that both siblings can grow and take up the available space or set `flexShrink` to `0` on sibling component.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/flexbox/TextInsideContainer.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## How to build overlapping components?

This can be achieved by using position type as `YogaPositionType.ABSOLUTE`. Also, the exact left/right coordinates for the starting position of the absolute child can be set.
For information on making components overlap each other, see [Absolutely positioned items](yoga-playground.mdx#absolutely-positioned-items).

## How to center components?

Use the following to center components:

* `[alignItems](#distribution-along-the-cross-axis) = CENTER` - to center components inside the `Row` along the vertical axis.
* `[justifyContent](/docs/mainconcepts/flexbox-yoga#distribution-along-the-main-axis) = CENTER` - to center components inside the `Row` along the horizontal axis.

If it is specific to `Text`, then consider using `verticalGravity`/`horizontalGravity` props of the `Text` component to keep it center-aligned:

```kotlin
  Text(
    text = "Align this text at center vertically using vertical gravity",
    verticalGravity = VerticalGravity.CENTER,
    textSize = 20.sp))
```

## If `flexGrow`/`flexShrink` has been defined but doesn't do anything

If the parent has fixed `width`/`height` then `flexGrow`/`flexShrink` is not expected to work correctly since there is not enough space for it to work with. Check in the component hierarchy if the component that is getting clipped has enough width/height needed to render it completely.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/flexbox/TextInColumnWithExactHeight.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## When the keyboard opens, the content is cut off

When there is a screen for which input is required (such as when the layout contains a `TextInput`), then the layout now needs to fit inside a small space (here, height is the concern).

There are multiple ways to solve this:

1. Check if the text is cut off due to [`flexShrink` issues](#why-is-my-text-truncated) or check the setting for [exact `width`/`height` on parent components](#if-flexgrowflexshrink-has-been-defined-but-doesnt-do-anything) in the hierarchy.

2. Make the content scrollable by placing it in a `VerticalScroll`.

  ```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/flexbox/ContentInVerticalScroll.kt start=start_example end=end_example
  ```

3. Keep a state value that tracks whether the keyboard is open or not, then change the layout accordingly, depending on the state.
