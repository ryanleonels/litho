`useEffect` is a hook that allows a component to perform side-effects[^1] when it's attached and/or detached from the tree, or in response to changes in committed props or state.

[^1]: Side-effects include operations such as fetch requests, subscriptions, using timers, and manually changing the View tree. By using the useEffect hook, you are stating that the component needs to do someting after its rendered.

To familiarize yourself with the concept and rules for hooks, see the [Introduction to Hooks](hooks-intro.mdx) page.

## Performing side-effects

:::note
`useEffect` lambdas and cleanup are both invoked on the main thread. This means it's safe to trigger animations or mutate the view hierarchy from it. However, it's recommended to avoid expensive operations in order to keep your app responsive!
:::

`useEffect` accepts an *effect lambda* to invoke when the component is attached to the tree. Besides performing a side-effect, like subscribing to a data store, the effect lambda should also return a *cleanup lambda*, which is invoked when the component no longer exists in the tree.

```kotlin
useEffect(Unit) {
  println("I've been attached!")
  onCleanup { println("I've been detached!") }
}
```

The arguments to `useEffect` are its dependencies, which control when the effect is cleaned up and invoked again. With `Unit` passed as a dependency arg, the effect lambda is invoked **only once** when a component is added to UI tree, and the cleanup lambda is invoked **only once** when a component is removed from the UI tree. They won't be called when a component is updated due to the props or state changes.

You can have a finer-grained control of how often your effect and cleanup lambdas need to be executed using dependency args, as shown in the next section.

## Side-effects with dependencies

:::note
Dependencies are checked for equivalence by calling `equals`. If any are not equal, the hook will be cleaned up and called again.
:::

In addition to the effect lambda `useEffect` also accepts a var-arg list of *dependencies*. These dependencies are the props and/or state which affect the side-effect performed. When dependencies are supplied, the effect lambda (along with the previous cleanup lambda, if applicable) will only be invoked on initial attach and any commit in which any of those dependencies have changed.

In the sample code below, when the first render is committed, Litho will invoke the `useEffect` lambda, subscribing to the current `userId`. On subsequent commits, **if `userId` or `store` changed**, Litho invokes the cleanup callback to unsubscribe the existing subscription (if there is one) and then subscribe to the current `userId` and `store`.

```kotlin
class UserStatusComponent(private val userId: Int, private val store: StatusStore) : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val status = useState { Status.PENDING }
    val subscription = useRef<Subscription?> { null }

    useEffect(userId, store) {
      subscription.value = store.subscribe(userId) { newStatus -> status.update(newStatus) }
      onCleanup { store.unsubscribe(subscription.value) }
    }

    return Text(text = "$userId is ${status.value}")
  }
}
```

In general, your dependencies should include **all** the props/state read by you `useEffect`/`onCleanup` calls. If they don't, you risk incorrect behavior. For example, in the above component, if `userId` hadn't been specified, then if the component received a different `userId` as a prop, it would remain subscribed to the wrong `userId`.

### Cleanup

The return value of the lambda passed to `useEffect` is a cleanup lambda. This is where you should perform any cleanup necessary to undo side-effects from the main body of that `useEffect` call. For example, canceling a subscription to a data store, or canceling an animation. If you don't have any cleanup you need to do, you can return `null` instead:

```kotlin
useEffect {
  Toast.makeText(androidContext, "Component rendered", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
  null // return null, no cleanup necessary
}
```

### Unconditionally triggering side-effects

In rare cases you may need to pass `Any()` as a dependency arg. In such a case, **on each** new commit, the cleanup for the previous `useEffect` call is invoked, followed by the current `useEffect` call.

### Listening to Prop/State Changes

An important functionality that `useEffect` adds is the ability to trigger code when props/state change. As an example, this could be used to trigger an animation as a side-effect whenever some prop changes:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/animatedcounter/AnimatedCounter.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## Known issues

### `useEffect` in Components that can return `null` or `EmptyComponent` from `render`

If you specify an effect via `useEffect` and then return `null` from `render`, or render to a child which returns `null` from render (like `EmptyComponent`), then the effect won't run.

Until this is fixed, the workaround is to return an empty `Row()` from render instead of null.
