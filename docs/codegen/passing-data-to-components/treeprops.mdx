:::caution
This page covers the old Java Spec API. If the Spec API is not being used, refer to the [TreeProps](../../mainconcepts/props.mdx#tree-props) section of the 'Types of Props' page.
:::

A TreeProp is a special type of [prop](props.md) that is transparently passed from a parent component to its children. It provides a convenient way to share contextual data or utilities in a tree without having to explicitly pass props to every component in a hierarchy.

A good example of a TreeProp is a 'prefetcher', which fetches network images ahead of render time. Since images are commonplace, the prefetcher is widely used. The prefetcher implementation might be defined for any component that needs to use it, without having to pass it as a prop in the entire component hierarchy.

## Declaring a TreeProp

<Tabs
  groupId="tree_prop_tab_group"
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin API', value: 'kotlin'},
    {label: 'Spec API', value: 'java'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

In order to declare a TreeProp, use `TreePropProvider`:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ParentKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java">

Each TreeProp is declared and created from a method annotated with `@OnCreateTreeProp`:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ParentComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Only one TreeProp can be declared for any one given type. If a child of `ParentComponent` also defines a TreeProp of type `Prefetcher`, it will override the value of that TreeProp for all its children (but not for itself).
:::

## Using a TreeProp

<Tabs
  groupId="tree_prop_tab_group"
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin API', value: 'kotlin'},
    {label: 'Spec API', value: 'java'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

The child component can access the TreeProp value through a `ComponentScope.getTreeProp<Type>()` method call, where `Type` is the same type that was provided in the `TreePropProvider` call in one of its parents.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ChildKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="java">

The child component can access the TreeProp value through a parameter annotated with `@TreeProp` that has the same type as the return type of one of the `@OnCreateTreeProp` methods defined in the ancestors of child component.

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ChildComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution IMPORTANT
Once created, the TreeProp value is passed down to all children but isn't accessible from the component that created the TreeProp.
:::

To access a TreeProp from the component that created it, transform it into [State](../state-for-specs.md) as follows:

<Tabs
  groupId="tree_prop_tab_group"
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin API', value: 'kotlin'},
    {label: 'Spec API', value: 'java'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ParentComponentTreePropAsStateKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java">

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/ParentComponentTreePropAsStateSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## TreeProps with Lists

TreeProps can be used in components, sections and lazy collections. They can even be modified between them.

The following code is an example of a logging data structure that is passed down from the root component to capture information about the hierarchy.

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/LogContext.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

:::tip
Immutable TreeProps are easier to understand so try to follow that design pattern whenever possible.
:::

The following diagram shows the component hierarchy.

<Tabs
  groupId="tree_prop_tab_group"
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin API', value: 'kotlin'},
    {label: 'Spec API', value: 'java'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

Start by setting up the `RootComponent` with the `LazyList` as one of its children:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/RootKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

The TopGroupKComponent takes in the root TreeProp and adds its `"top"` tag to it:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/TopGroupKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

The bottom part here has been omitted for brevity, but it can be found in the repository under [samples](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops).

The leaf node renders the TreeProp as text in the example case but would normally perform some sort of logging based on the context:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/LeafKComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java">

Start by setting up the `RootComponent` with the `RecyclerCollectionComponent` as one of its children:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/RootComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

The TopGroupSection takes in the root TreeProp and adds its `"top"` tag to it:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/TopGroupSectionSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

The bottom part has been omitted here for brevity, but it can be found in the repository under [samples](https://github.com/facebook/litho/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops).

The leaf node simply renders the TreeProp as text in our example case here, but would normally perform some sort of logging based on the context:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/documentation/treeprops/LeafComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The on-screen result is three rows of text that read:

- `"root:leaf"`
- `"root:top:leaf"`
- `"root:top:bottom:leaf"`

This illustrates how TreeProps propagate through both component and section trees and can be used to selectively share information with their children.
