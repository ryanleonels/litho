:::caution
This section contains information about the old Java Spec API.
For new development, the Kotlin API is recommended (see the [Components](mainconcepts/components-basics.mdx) page in the 'Main Concepts' section).
:::

The documentation for Codegen APIs includes the following pages:

* [Layout Specs](layout-specs.mdx) - the logical equivalents of composite views on Android.
* [Mount Specs](mount-specs.md) - components that can render views or drawables.
* [Dynamic Props](dynamic-props.mdx) - illustrates properties that are applied directly to a View or Drawable and are updated without computing a layout or remounting.
* [Accessibility](accessibility-overview.md) - explains why accessibility is important and how to implement accessibility features, and lists the supported accessibility events of the `Style` object.
* [Sections API](sections/start.mdx) - documentation for the Sections API for writing lists.
* [Props](passing-data-to-components/props.md) and [TreeProps](passing-data-to-components/treeprops.mdx) - the ways you can pass data to components.
* [State in Specs](state-for-specs.md) - data that is encapsulated and managed within the component and is transparent to its parent.
* [Events for Specs](events-for-specs.md) - a general-purpose API to connect components with one another.
* [Triggering Events with Handles](trigger-events.md) - how to use a `Handle` to trigger events on components.
